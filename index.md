IBPSA Modelica Working Group will create open-source software
that builds the basis of next generation computing tools
for the design and
operation of building and district energy and control systems.
It extends work conducted under the
[IEA EBC Annex 60](http://www.iea-annex60.org) and [IBPSA Project 1](https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/).
All work is open-source and built on the [Modelica](http://www.modelica.org) standard for modeling the performance of building and district energy systems.

<h2>Working group purpose</h2>
The main task, which is highlighted in the proposal
[workplan](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-working-group/blob/main/reports/2023-proposal-approved/build/latex/ibpsa_modelica.pdf), is the continuation of IBPSAProject 1 Work Package 1.1 "Modelica library development" under the new name of "Modelica Working Group".

This working group develops the free open-source Modelica IBPSA Library
(<a href="https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa">github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa</a>),
which is a library of models for the design and operation of
building and community energy and control systems.
The Modelica IBPSA Library is used as the core of the four Modelica libraries:
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib">AixLib </a>,
 from RWTH Aachen University, Germany,
</li>
<li>
 <a href="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica">Buildings</a>,
 from LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA,
</li>
<li>
 <a href="http://www.modelica-buildingsystems.de">BuildingSystems</a>,
 from UdK Berlin, Germany, and
 </li>
 <li>
 <a href="https://github.com/open-ideas/IDEAS">IDEAS</a>,
 from KU Leuven, Belgium.
 </li>
 </ul>
<p>
All models are documented and validated against analytical solutions, against
the results of other simulators or against measurement data.
</p>
<p>
Through these libraries, models of the Modelica IBPSA Library are also used in derivative software, such as in  <a href="https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest">BOPTEST </a>, <a href="https://lbl-srg.github.io/soep/"> Spawn of EnergyPlus</a>,<a href="https://docs.urbanopt.net/workflows/des.html"> URBANopt</a>  for District Energy Systems, Electricity de Franceâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/EDF-Lab/BuildSysPro"> BuildSysPro Library</a>, PennState Smart and Connected Communities <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/sbslab/tools/smart-and-connected-communities-scc-library/"> SCC Library </a> and Net Zero Energy <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/sbslab/tools/net-zero-energy-community-nzec-library/"> (NZEC) Library</a> .
The Modelica IBPSA Library is being tested with the three Modelica tools OpenModelica, OPTIMICA/IMPACT and Dymola.
</p>
<p>
The working group also
coordinates the needs of the IBPSA community with the Modelica Association and with Modelica modeling and simulation environment developers.
