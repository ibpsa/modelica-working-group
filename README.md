This public repository is for the administration of the IBPSA Modelica Working Group.
The project web page is at https://ibpsa.github.io/modelica-working-group/.

The Working Group is conducted under the umbrella of the
International Building Performance Simulaton Association (https://ibpsa.org/).

The purpose and scope of the Working Group includes the following:

1. Maintain and further develop the [Modelica IBPSA Library](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa).
   The Working Group shall follow state of the art principles that ensure that models are reviewed,
   validated and well documented.
   The development shall respond to the requirements of 3rd party libraries that integrate
   the Modelica IBPSA Library as its core library.
   The Modelica IBPSA Library shall remain available under the existing BSD license.

2. Coordinate the needs of the IBPSA community with the Modelica Association and
   with Modelica modeling and simulation environment developers.
