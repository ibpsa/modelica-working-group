The case study described in more detail in Ref. [1] aims to evaluate energy performance and thermal dynamics of a university teaching building at SDU, Denmark. The building surface area is 8500 m2. There are 3 above-ground floors containing classrooms (40% of floor area), study zones (25%), offices (15%), and common spaces (20%). There is also a basement level containing main HVAC facilities and the main heat exchanger connected to district heating. The building can accommodate maximum 1350 people. The entire building is modelled as a single thermal zone.
The system consists of mainly two parts (Fig.1):
<ul>
  <li>a hydronic heating loop supplying heat to the building. It has two branches: one goes to indoor radiator, the other proceeds to air handling unit preheating supply air to specific temperature set point. A district heating system is providing heat to ensure supply the hydronic heating circuit.</li>
  <li>a CO2-driven ventilation system that controls indoor CO2 concentration to specified level. Mass flow rate of supply air is controlled ensuring that indoor CO2 concentration does not exceed specific level.</li>
</ul>

Domestic hot water is supplied by a separate system which is not included in the model. The model has been calibrated based on measured data collected from a large number of sensors. Results from simulation studies show that the model is physically realistic in terms of heat load, electric load and thermal comfort estimation and a new control/actuation setup considerably improves simulation time, achieving relatively small monthly simulation time of 6.4 minutes.
