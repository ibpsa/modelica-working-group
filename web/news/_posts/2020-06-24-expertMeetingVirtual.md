The 6th Expert Meeting of IBPSA Modelica Working Group will take place as a web meeting on Oct. 13 and 14, 2020, 7am-10am Pacific Daylight Time.

<!--excerpt-->

The meeting will be over two days, with four hours per day. The meeting will have overview sessions to coordinate the research in the various work packages, several breakout sessions, and a special session about the integration of data-driven approaches with physics-based methods in the various research conducted by Modelica Working Group.

During the special session, Jan Drgona (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) will present opportunities to better connect our community with the AI community and Henrik Madson (Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby) will present data-driven modelling, forecasting and control for buildings in the future low carbon society. A follow on plenary discussion and the break out groups will be used to discuss how these recent developments should be addressed in the work of Modelica Working Group.
