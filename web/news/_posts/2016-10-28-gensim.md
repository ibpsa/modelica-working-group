<!--excerpt-->

Following the completion of the research phase of Annex 60,
Etienne Wurtz from CEA, France, and Michael Wetter from LBNL, USA,
organized the GENSIM scientific school. GENSIM took place
from October 24th until October 28th in Porticcio, France.
Its main purpose was to teach Modelica, FMI, BIM and GIS
for building and community energy system simulation,
to report on results of the IEA EBC Annex 60, and to organize its continuation
as the [IBPSA Project 1](https://ibpsa.github.io/project1).
GENSIM was sponsored by IBPSA France and attended by 65 participants.
