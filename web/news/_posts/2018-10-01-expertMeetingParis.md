at ENGIE Lab, hosted by Valentin Gavan and Lisa Rivalin.
The meeting was attended by 40 people. The main focus of meeting was to coordinate the work of the various work packages.
There was also a
well received keynote by Loraine Devouton from ENGIE Lab,
who stressed the importance of
optimizing the energy infrastructure across the different subsystems,
of which district heating and cooling are an important
backbone.
