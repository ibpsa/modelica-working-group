On December 10, 2015 in Hyderabad, the Board of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) approved to start project 1 "BIM/GIS and Modelica framework for building and community energy system design and operation" in June 2017 for a duration of 5 years, run by the co-operating agents Michael Wetter and Christoph van Treeck.

<!--excerpt-->

This will be the first project executed under the umbrella of IBPSA. It gives the opportunity to continue parts of Annex 60 when it terminates in June 2017. Detailed planning will start in Spring 2016, and the project is expected to officially start in June 2017. Interested participants should contact Michael Wetter (mwetter@lbl.gov) and Christoph van Treeck (treeck@e3d.rwth-aachen.de).
