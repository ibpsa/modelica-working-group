This is a working meeting to coordinate technical work on Project 1.

*Who should attend?*

Attendees are expected to have contributed to IBPSA Project 1, or plan to make contributions to the project.
These expert meetings are important to coordinate the work within the tasks and among the tasks.
Therefore, participation by people who work on the project is important.
Attendance at the Expert Meeting is required for Organizational Participants (see [https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/participants.html](https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/participants.html)).

The meeting is kindly sponsored by the [Trottier Energy Institute](http://iet.polymtl.ca/en/), who will cover all meeting costs with the exception of the group dinner. The registration fee of 60 CAD covers the group dinner.

The Trottier Energy Institute will also fund the organization of a public seminar and cocktail. The theme of the public seminar will be the applications of simulation towards the design and operation of building and community energy systems, and both local practitioners and researchers will be invited to attend. This is an important opportunity for dissemination of the work accomplished under IBPSA Project 1.
