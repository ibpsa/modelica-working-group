On April 3 and 4, 2019, the IBPSA Project 1 held its 3rd Expert Meeting.
The meeting took place
at RWTH Aachen, Germany, hosted by Christoph van Treeck and Dirk MÃ¼ller,
and was attended by 50 people.

The meeting coordinated the ongoing work in the various tasks.
A joint session between Tasks 1 and 2 highlighted the opportunities
to integrate Modelica with the building construction process,
with design tools and a digitization of the control design, deployment
and verification process.
A presentation about the semantic web for digital construction processes
presented a framework that can be extended for more streamlined integration
of currently isolated processes.
Moreover, work continued on developing the BOPTEST infrastructure for comparison
of advanced control sequences, and of DESTEST, a validation suite for district
energy systems. For the application work package, a common template to report
on case study has been developed.
